Each\nagreement is insulated from the others and contains its own audit report. Each recipient is unaware of all other\nrecipients. The sender has access to the agreements through their Home or Documents tab or through the Send in bulk\ntemplate, which contains an Agreements report that tracks the overall status of the child agreements created from the\ntemplate. Additionally, the sender can export the field-level data of all completed agreements in a CSV format using the\nDownload Form Field Data action.",
